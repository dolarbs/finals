										Steve Holland - Assistant first team coach
										MANAGEMENT TEAM

										Following the success of his reserve side, who became national champions in 2011, reserve coach Steve Holland stepped up to work with the senior squad that summer, becoming an assistant first team coach.

										First as a member of Andre Villas-Boas's backroom staff, then under Roberto Di Matteo, Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink, Steve is an important link between the first team and Academy, as well as playing a key role on the training field. His work was rewarded at the end of the 2011/12 as the players lifted the FA Cup and Champions League trophy, and then the Europa League trophy in 2013.

										In September 2013 he assisted England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate in preparations for two international games at that level. At the end of the month it was announced he would stay in the role.

										Following the departure of England manager Sam Allardyce in September 2016, Southgate and Holland stepped up to take charge of the senior team initially on an interim basis. Following Southgate's role being made permanent, it was announced in December 2016 that Holland will become England assistant manager on a full-time basis from the end of the season. Until then he remains in his role at Chelsea apart from for two England fixtures in March 2017 when he joins up with the Three Lions squad.

										Steve was originally appointed as Chelsea reserve team manager in August 2009, following five months spent as Stoke City's Academy director.
