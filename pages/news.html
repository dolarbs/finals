									Giles Smith’s Thursday Thoughts
								COLUMN THU 29 DEC 2016

								From Santa’s gifts to the less eager-to-please Stoke City. Columnist and supporter Giles Smith sums up the week in his latest column…

								 

								So, after all the protracted build-up and the feverishly mounting anticipation as the big day neared, Santa brought us three points and a 3-0 win over Bournemouth. Clever old Santa.

								And for once it was next to impossible to get that immediate feeling of deflation which so often lingers amid the shredded wrapping paper during the festive season. Certainly I can’t imagine any of us will be taking our victory back on the grounds that it doesn’t quite fit or because we already had one.

								In fact, to be perfectly frank about it, we already had 11, and this Bournemouth one made 12, which is a new club record. We weren’t short of victories, in other words. But, really, it’s like socks: you can’t have too many. And it’s not like any of the 12 are the same, when you look at them, side by side. All of them are different – and none more different than this one against Bournemouth, in fact, what with the changes forced upon the team by the seemingly critical absences of N’Golo Kante and Diego Costa.

									Everybody is feeling good.

									It was important for us to start winning. As you know, we didn’t start well but the confidence is there now and we hope we can continue like this.

									Looking to the future we have two very difficult games in the Premier League and Champions League. Newcastle have had a difficult start to the season and will want to show their quality. We have had three wins in a row though and I think this will help us a lot.

									Of course to win against Arsenal is always something special. It is a big derby for us and they are a team like us that wants to win the title. It was a big moment and we are happy to take all three points, but also to have a good performance as well.

									We deserved the win, as well as against Maccabi Tel Aviv and Walsall, and it seems like something has changed for us finally, after a frustrating start. We know we didn’t have any luck in some games and the manager talked about it a lot, but we have worked in the same way and eventually been rewarded.

									Over land and sea
									Recently I was on the Hogwart’s Express discussing a trip to watch Chelsea play. There’s a sentence I never thought I’d write.

									I took my nine-year-old daughter Nicola to Universal Studios in Florida because she is obsessed by the Harry Potter books. A full-size replica of the train chugs between the two theme parks and we shared our carriage with a family of four from the Mid-West.

									They were from Minneapolis and I said I had been there in August to see the Blues’ pre-season friendly against AC Milan in the Bank of America Stadium. The father couldn’t believe it. This was neither a reflection on my perceived wealth nor a judgment on the strength of our current squad, he just couldn’t fathom why I had trekked from Louisiana to Minnesota to see a sporting event.

									New Orleans to his hometown is about 1,000 miles - the same as from London to Vilnius, Lithuania - a fair hike for sure but hardly end-of-the-earth, Sir Ranulph Fiennes-style territory.
